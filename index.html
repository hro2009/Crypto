                </p>
                <h2>Decide which currencies you want to buy and sell:</h2>
                <p>Ever since the official release of bitcoin in January 2009, cryptocurrencies have been making waves. Bitcoin has been the top currency in terms of market cap for a while now.

                <h2>Tip 3: Decide whether you want to buy or trade</h2>
                <p>You can decide to own units of cryptocurrency, or to trade on the price of cryptocurrency. By trading, you can speculate on the price without ever taking ownership, using derivatives trading instruments called cryptocurrency CFDs.</p>
                <p>With a unit of cryptocurrency, you have to pay in full for the price of the asset. With trading, you only have to put up a small proportion of your total position size. This allows you to take a leveraged position on the price, gaining a greater exposure than might otherwise be available with your investment amount.</p>
                <p>There are a number of tax advantages to trading over investing. You don’t have to pay capital gains on the profits of trading cryptocurrencies, whereas you do if you profit from buying and selling cryptocurrency direct.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the trading approach can magnify losses if you get your strategy wrong.

                <h2>Tip 4: Are you a natural cryptocurrency investor?</h2>
                <p>Trading in cryptocurrencies is not for the faint-hearted. Over the past 6 months, the price of bitcoin has been as high as low as 3,000 and and as high as 14,000. The good news is that we are in another long term bull market. If you’re more of a ‘cash under the bed’ type, this probably isn’t the area for you. But if you are willing to take some risk or are excited by investigating in new technologies then this could be an interesting area to explore.</p>
